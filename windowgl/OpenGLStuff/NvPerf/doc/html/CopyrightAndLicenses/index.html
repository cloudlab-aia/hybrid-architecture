                     <p class="p">This SLA, any Supplements incorporated hereto, and Orders constitute the entire agreement
                        of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereto and supersede all prior
                        negotiations, conversations, or discussions between the parties relating to the subject
                        matter hereto, oral or written, and all past dealings or industry custom. Any additional
                        and/or conflicting terms and conditions on purchase order(s) or any other documents
                        issued by you are null, void, and invalid. Any amendment or waiver under the AGREEMENT
                        must be in writing and signed by representatives of both parties.
                     </p>
                     <p class="p">The AGREEMENT and the rights and obligations thereunder may not be assigned by you, in
                        whole or in part, including by merger, consolidation, dissolution, operation of law, or
                        any other manner, without written consent of NVIDIA, and any purported assignment in
                        violation of this provision shall be void and of no effect. NVIDIA may assign, delegate
                        or transfer the AGREEMENT and its rights and obligations hereunder, and if to a
                        non-Affiliate you will be notified.
                     </p>
                     <p class="p">Each party acknowledges and agrees that the other is an independent contractor in the
                        performance of the AGREEMENT, and each party is solely responsible for all of its
                        employees, agents, contractors, and labor costs and expenses arising in connection
                        therewith. The parties are not partners, joint ventures or otherwise affiliated, and
                        neither has any authority to make any statements, representations or commitments of any
                        kind to bind the other party without prior written consent.
                     </p>
                     <p class="p">Neither party will be responsible for any failure or delay in its performance under the
                        AGREEMENT (except for any payment obligations) to the extent due to causes beyond its
                        reasonable control for so long as such force majeure event continues in effect.
                     </p>
                     <p class="p">The AGREEMENT will be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of Delaware
                        and the United States without regard to the conflicts of law provisions thereof and
                        without regard to the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale
                        of Goods. The parties consent to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state
                        courts located in Santa Clara County, California. You acknowledge and agree that a
                        breach of any of your promises or agreements contained in the AGREEMENT may result in
                        irreparable and continuing injury to NVIDIA for which monetary damages may not be an
                        adequate remedy and therefore NVIDIA is entitled to seek injunctive relief as well as
                        such other and further relief as may be appropriate. If any court of competent
                        jurisdiction determines that any provision of the AGREEMENT is illegal, invalid or
                        unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect. Unless
                        otherwise specified, remedies are cumulative.

                     <div class="body"><pre class="pre" xml:space="preserve">A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope
Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software
Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a
non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related
Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of
the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
the various releases.

    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-
                    from                                compatible? (1)

    0.9.0 thru 1.2              1991-1995   CWI         yes
    1.3 thru 1.5.2  1.2         1995-1999   CNRI        yes
    1.6             1.5.2       2000        CNRI        no
    2.0             1.6         2000        BeOpen.com  no
    1.6.1           1.6         2001        CNRI        yes (2)
    2.1             2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         no
    2.0.1           2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         yes
    2.1.1           2.1+2.0.1   2001        PSF         yes
    2.1.2           2.1.1       2002        PSF         yes
    2.1.3           2.1.2       2002        PSF         yes
    2.2 and above   2.1.1       2001-now    PSF         yes

Footnotes:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
    is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
direction to make these releases possible.

                           royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make,
                           have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where
                           such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that
                           are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their
                           Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                           institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or
                           counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated
                           within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any
                           patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as
                           of the date such litigation is filed.
